## Purpose
* Make Turning in Work Simple
* Make Turning in Work Automated
* Make Turnover Time Shorter

## Coding Style and Formatting Guide

#### For Python Code( same as last year )
* [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

#### For C Code
* [Linux Kernel Coding Style( only look at relevant parts please )](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html#)
#### For GIT
* [Git Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* [Git Ticketing](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug)
* [Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53)
* [Adding issuenumbers(refs)](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) 
(This Will Be Continuously updated, but this should be a basis for now)
## completed deliverables
 - [x] inverted pendulum( pygame )

## upcoming deliverables
**Quadrotor LQR Controller ( pygame )**
```diff
- due: oct 12-24th
```
 - [ ] Python Based Controller ( pid or lqr )
    * Must be simulated with pygame ( experimental points for doing it with blender )
    * Must Indicate Equations of Motion( Latex is Optimal )

 - [ ] Can be in C++/C
    * Using C++11/C99
    * Must be Ported to Python
    * Must be Easy to use and Well Document( see above for details )

 - [ ] Python Optimization Libraries are allowed
    * scipy
    * numpy
    * control( fine, but see if it exists in the above first )
    * nobody wants to install yet *MORE* dependencies on my computer thanks ( management )

**GigE Vision Driver**
```diff
- due October 12th
```
**Linux Config(RTOS)**
```diff
- due: October 12th
```
**C/C++ Software Exam**
```diff
- due: October 19th
```
